# Predator–Prey Simulator

## Overview
This project is a **C++ predator–prey simulation** where agents are controlled by **neural networks** trained through **evolutionary methods**. Predators and prey interact in a simulated environment, and behaviors emerge through selection and mutation over generations.

The project is inspired by the final project of a course I took at IMSA called Computational Science, where the entire class wrote deterministic or MLP-based policies for lynx and hare and competed in a “Hunger Games” style arena to see whose hare would survive the longest.

## Status
Work in progress

## To-Do
- Neural Network brain for agents (trained via evolution)
